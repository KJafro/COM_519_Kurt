## Introduction
Atletas is a group of 3 local Spanish doctors who have come together to gather data from friends and family as 'Entries' to prove the innaccuracy of BMI (Body Mass Index). The reason for this project is because
BMI can be misleading which can possibly lead to eating disorders for healthy normal weight people. Normally BMI calculators focus on your height and weight whereas the information from this application would 
gather more important factors which will be explained in the Database Design. 

## System Overview
Due to the nature of the project the system will be a basic design using MVC Framework which seperates the application into the different components. The website focuses on a minimal design with the homepage featuring a basic BMI calculator which ask for the users height and weight and depending on the result it will shows whether the user how healthy the individual is - this isn't enough information to determine whether the individual is healthy. 

The user will be able to register using an e-mail and password and they will be able to add new Entries.

Once logged in the user will be allowed to
add information such as the Full Name, Gender, Height, Weight, Bodyfat and the BMI - then the user will be able to 'Select Profile' which shows on the system which specific doctor added the entry.
